                      via droplets spread through contact with an infected individual (Zhou et al., 2004). 
                      This disease was identified in the early 2000s and due to its high infectivity was able 
                      to spread quickly and internationally (Zhou et al., 2004). Through drastic public health 
                      measures the spread of the disease was controled, but peaked mathematical modler's 
                      interest (Zhou et al., 2004). In order to have an idea of how this disease was spreading 
                      the authors created a mathematical model that allows for them to predict the number of 
                      indviduals that contracted SARS over a given amount of days (Zhou et al., 2004). 
                      In their model they have a multitude of parameters that they estimate based on their 
                      given data, to predict the number of indviduals diagnosed with SARS on a given day based 
                      on the starting valuesand parameter values (Zhou et al., 2004). The authors utilize their 
                      own data to estimate the model parameters, but we find that this model could be beneficial 
                      for other similar infectious diseases. Thus we have created this app which allows for 
                      public health officials to input parameters that were estimated based on their own data 
                      to predict the number of sick, exposed or infected indviduals after t days."),

                      a user can click on the box and there is a pop up that tells them what each
