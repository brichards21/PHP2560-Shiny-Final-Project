                                via droplets spread through contact with an infected individual (Zhou et al., 2004). 
                                This disease was identified in the early 2000s and due to its high infectivity was able 
                                to spread quickly and internationally (Zhou et al., 2004). Through drastic public health 
                                measures the spread of the disease was controlled, but peaked mathematical modler's 
                                interest (Zhou et al., 2004). In order to have an idea of how this disease was spreading 
                                the authors created a mathematical model that allows for them to predict the number of 
                                indviduals that contracted SARS over a given amount of days (Zhou et al., 2004). 
                                In their model they have a multitude of parameters that they estimate based on their 
                                given data, to predict the number of indviduals diagnosed with SARS on a given day based 
                                on the starting valuesand parameter values (Zhou et al., 2004). After seeing how accurate
                                this model is we believe it could be beneficial 
                                for other similar infectious diseases. Thus we have created this app which allows for 
                                public health officials to input parameters that were estimated based on their own data 
                                to predict the number of diagnosed, exposed, infected, quarantined, and recovered 
                                indviduals after t days.
