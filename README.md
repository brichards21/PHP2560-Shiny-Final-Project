SARS is an infectious disease that spreads via droplets spread through contact with in the early 2000s (Zhou et al., 2004). The spread of this disease was m China, which lead to concern regarding the spread of disease (Zhou et al., 2004). In order to have an idea of how this disease was spreading the authors created a mathematical model that allows for them to predict the number of indviduals that contracted SARS over a given amount of days (Zhou et al., 2004). In their model they have a multitude of parameters that they estimate based on their given data, to predict the number of indviduals diagnosed with SARS on a given day based on the starting valuesand parameter values (Zhou et al., 2004). In order to increase the utility of this model we have created this app that allows for a user to simulate the spread of a disease based on their own estimated parameters from their data.
