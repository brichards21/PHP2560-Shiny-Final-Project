SARS is an infectious disease that spreads via droplets spread through contact with an infected individual (Zhou et al., 2004). This disease was identified in the early 2000s and due to its high infectivity was able to spread quickly and internationally (Zhou et al., 2004). Through drastic public health measures the spread of the disease was controled, but peaked mathematical modler's interest (Zhou et al., 2004). In order to have an idea of how this disease was spreading the authors created a mathematical model that allows for them to predict the number of indviduals that contracted SARS over a given amount of days (Zhou et al., 2004). In their model they have a multitude of parameters that they estimate based on their given data, to predict the number of indviduals diagnosed with SARS on a given day based on the starting valuesand parameter values (Zhou et al., 2004). In order to increase the utility of this model we have created this app that allows for a user to simulate the spread of a disease based on their own estimated parameters from their data.
